    {{--<h2>What principles, values and beliefs shape your approach to health care?</h2>--}}
    <p>Your body is a self-healing, self-regulating organism with an intelligent instinct for survival. It is constantly monitoring and responding to every event that takes place - both internally and externally - consciously and unconsciously - at every moment of every day. The collection of events, your perception of them, and your response to them all come together to determine your position on the sliding scale of health and disease. </p>
    <p>If given the opportunity, your body will naturally gravitate towards health, well-being and vitality. (This is fantastic, and provides great hope to those who are unwell!) However, due to lifestyle choices and environmental stressors, the opportunity to thrive is often hindered or obstructed. When your body is provided with inadequate or toxic resources, it is unable to support both health and survival simultaneously. In such conditions, your feeling of well-being takes a hit in order to prioritize survival. While the survival response may result in symptoms that are unpleasant, they are necessary in order for life to continue in the given conditions. (May be helpful to include some examples.) The continuation of life, though unpleasant for the time being, gives you the wake-up call you need and an opportunity to make whatever changes are necessary to improve your conditions, thus allowing your body to return to the natural state of health it has been longing for! </p>
    <p>My aim, using a combination of (gentle, non-invasive/natural/restorative) treatment and lifestyle advice (training/coaching), is to work in harmony with your body's efforts to restore and maintain health, well-being and vitality. This approach to care is safe, effective, free from harmful side-effects, and provides benefits both now and for the rest of your life.</p>
