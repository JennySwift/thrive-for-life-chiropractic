    {{--<h2>What do you love about being a chiropractor?</h2>--}}

    <p>I love that it gives me so many opportunities to help people. I can't think of any aspect of life that isn't
        impacted by how well you feel. As a chiropractor I have the means to help people be well and have a positive
        impact on their life. This is both a privilege and a joy.</p>

    <p>I also love that fits beautifully into my natural, holistic approach to health care and allows me to provide a
        <a href="/services">service</a> that is congruent with my principles, values and beliefs.</p>
