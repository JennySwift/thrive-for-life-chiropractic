    <p>My interest in health doesn't stop when I finish work for the day. It infiltrates my whole life. After all, I need to keep myself healthy too! I enjoy learning about and doing pretty much anything that promotes health. Healthy eating and natural movement (I'm always up for a walk with family or friends) are two areas of significant interest at the moment, but I'm often coming across new and exciting things to investigate and try out. (Check out some of my recommendations in the
        <a href="/resources">resources</a> section.)</p>
    <p>Family is another important part of my life - both my biological family and my church family. It's a blessing to be able to share life with so many wonderful people! </p>
    <p>And the list wouldn't be complete without music. Whether it's listening to my favourite songs or playing my guitar, music brings much joy to my life. </p>
