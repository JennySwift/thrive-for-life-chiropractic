        <h1>Health-Promoting Lifestyle Advice</h1>

        <p>Chiropractic care is powerful in helping restore and maintain optimal movement, alignment, and neurological function - all of which are vitally important to health - however my aim is to give you the most benefit for the least amount of treatment, and in order to achieve that I need to help you understand the cause of your problems. Understanding the cause empowers you to be part of the solution. It enables you to be proactive in maintaining the benefits of treatment and preventing further problems from occurring in the future. The overwhelming/vast majority of health problems are due to lifestyle. Nothing has a greater impact on your overall, long-term health, well-being, performance and vitality than your day-to-day habits and activities - how you eat, move, think, sleep, etc. Lifestyle is where the rubber hits the road. It's the biggest determining factor in whether you enjoy good health or suffer from chronic illness, and also how much treatment you will need. With this in mind, and my aim to give you the most benefit for the least amount of treatment (bang for your buck), lifestyle advice is a fundamental part of the care I provide. A healthy lifestyle beautifully complements and enhances/maximises the benefits of chiropractic care.</p>
