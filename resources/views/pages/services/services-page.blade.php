            <h1>Chiropractic</h1>
            <p>Your body is constantly monitoring and responding to every event that takes place - both internally and
                externally - consciously and unconsciously - at every moment of every day. It does this via the nervous
                system - your brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.</p>
            <p>Your nervous system is your control centre for living. It coordinates the activity of every single cell
                in your body. Its health and performance determine how you perceive everything that happens in and
                around you, and how you respond to it, which in turn determines whether you experience health or
                disease.</p>
            <p>Healthy movement and alignment, especially of the spine, is vital to the health of your nervous system.
                Unfortunately, living in an unnatural, toxic environment results in poor movement patterns and stiffness
                in and around your joints.</p>
            <p>Chiropractic helps restore and maintain optimal joint movement, alignment and function, thus optimising
                the health and performance of your nervous system, allowing your body to heal naturally and function as
                designed.</p>
            <p>My methods of assessment and treatment are safe, effective, and gentle enough for all ages.</p>

            <h1>Applied Kinesiology</h1>
            <p>Applied Kinesiology (AK) is a non-invasive diagnostic method that uses manual muscle testing to evaluate the integrity of the nervous system. Given that the nervous system monitors and coordinates every aspect of the body, AK can be used to evaluate the whole body and is helpful in discovering the reasons for functional disturbances and also in finding a solution.</p>

            <h1>Retained Neonatal Reflexes</h1>
            <p>Hard-wired into the nervous system (specifically the brainstem) are a number of reflexes which help
                children survive the birthing process and the early stages of life before they develop the ability to
                make decisions. These are called 'primitive' or 'neonatal' reflexes.</p>
            <p>As the nervous system matures, the neonatal reflexes are supposed to take a 'back seat' and allow the
                higher processing or thinking areas of the brain to take control. In some cases, however, the neonatal
                reflexes remain dominant (often due to significant stress such as birth trauma). This disharmony in the
                nervous system can result in undesirable reactions in certain situations and can adversely affect
                development, learning, coordination, and behaviour.</p>
            <p>Specific structural corrections can assist the integration of Retained Neonatal Reflexes, thus restoring
                harmony within the nervous system and allowing children to develop to their full potential.</p>
            <p>Retained Neonatal Reflexes can also be present in adults. Correcting/integrating them may help resolve
                chronic, recurring problems.</p>

            <p>The biggest determining factor in whether you enjoy good health or suffer from chronic illness, and also how much chiropractic treatment you will need, is lifestyle.

My health-promoting lifestyle advice enables you to be proactive in maintaining the benefits of treatment and preventing further problems from occurring in the future. It beautifully compliments and maximises the value of chiropractic care and is a fundamental part of the holistic service I offer.</p>
