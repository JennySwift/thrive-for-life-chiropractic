        <h1>Chiropractic</h1>

        <p>Your body is constantly monitoring and responding to every event that takes place - both internally and externally - consciously and unconsciously - at every moment of every day. It does this via the nervous system - your brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Your nervous system is your control centre for living. It coordinates the activity of every single cell in your body. Its health and performance determine how you perceive everything that happens in and around you, and how you respond to it, which in turn determines whether you experience health or disease. Healthy movement and alignment, especially of the spine, is vital to the health of your nervous system. Unfortunately, living in an unnatural, toxic environment results in poor movement patterns and stiffness in and around your joints. Chiropractic helps restore and maintain optimal joint movement, alignment and function, thus optimising the health and performance of your nervous system, allowing your body to function as designed - to heal and be well (express health, well-being and vitality). My methods of assessment and treatment are safe, effective, and gentle enough for all ages. </p>
