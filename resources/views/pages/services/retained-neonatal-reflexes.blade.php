        <h1>Retained Neonatal Reflexes</h1>

        <p>Hard-wired into the nervous system (specifically the brainstem) are a number of reflexes which help children survive the birthing process and the early stages of life before they develop the ability to make decisions. These are called 'primitive' or 'neonatal' reflexes. As the nervous system matures, the neonatal reflexes are supposed to take a 'back seat' and allow the higher processing or thinking areas of the brain to take control. In some cases, however, the neonatal reflexes remain dominant (often due to significant stress such as birth trauma). This disharmony in the nervous system can result in undesirable reactions in certain situations and can adversely affect development, learning, coordination, and behaviour. </p>
        <p>Specific structural corrections can assist the integration of Retained Neonatal Reflexes, thus restoring harmony within the nervous system and allowing children to develop to their full potential.</p>
        <p>Retained Neonatal Reflexes can also be present in adults. Correcting/integrating them may help resolve chronic, recurring problems. </p>
