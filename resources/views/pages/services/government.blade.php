            <p>Chronic Disease Management (formerly Enhanced Primary Care)</p>
            <p>If you have a chronic (or terminal) medical condition that is being managed by your GP you may be
                eligible to claim Medicare rebates for up to five allied health services (eg. chiropractic) each
                calendar year. A chronic medical condition is one that has been (or is likely to be) present for six
                months or longer.</p>
            <p>Eligibility requires a referral from your GP.</p>

            <p>Department of Veterans’ Affairs</p>
            <p>The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) funds all health services, provided under the Veterans’
                Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA), the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA) and the Military
                Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA), necessary to meet a clinical need for Gold Card
                holders. For White Card holders, DVA will fund those services required because of their accepted
                war-caused or service-related condition(s).</p>
            <p>Eligibility requires a referral.</p>

            <p>The National ADF Family Health Program provides $400 for each registered dependant per financial year to
                use towards GST-free non-cosmetic allied health services (eg. chiropractic) and/or to off-set the gap
                expenses for specialist consultations. This amount is a family allocation which can be transferred
                between family members (for example, a family of 3 dependants will be allocated $1,200 per financial
                year).</p>
