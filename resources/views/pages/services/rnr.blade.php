            <h1>Retained Neonatal Reflexes</h1>
            <p>Hard-wired into the nervous system (specifically the brainstem) are a number of reflexes which help
                children survive the birthing process and the early stages of life before they develop the ability to
                make decisions. These are called 'primitive' or 'neonatal' reflexes.</p>
            <p>As the nervous system matures, the neonatal reflexes are supposed to take a 'back seat' and allow the
                higher processing or thinking areas of the brain to take control. In some cases, however, the neonatal
                reflexes remain dominant (often due to significant stress such as birth trauma). This disharmony in the
                nervous system can result in undesirable reactions in certain situations and can adversely affect
                development, learning, coordination, and behaviour.</p>
            <p>Specific structural corrections can assist the integration of Retained Neonatal Reflexes, thus restoring
                harmony within the nervous system and allowing children to develop to their full potential.</p>
            <p>Retained Neonatal Reflexes can also be present in adults. Correcting/integrating them may help resolve
                chronic, recurring problems.</p>
