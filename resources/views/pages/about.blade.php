			<h3>What do you love about being a chiropractor?</h3>
			<p>I love having so many opportunities to help people. I can't think of any aspect of life that isn't impacted by how well you feel. As a chiropractor I have the means to help people be well and have a positive impact on their life. This is both a privilege and a joy.</p>
			<p>Another reason I love being a chiropractor is because it fits seamlessly/beautifully into my natural, holistic approach to health care, which you can read more about below. (link)</p>
			<p>Lastly, chiropractic is fun! The human body is amazing and it's often a lot of fun to work with and marvel at its healing capabilities.</p>
		
			<h3>What are your qualifications (what do all those letters mean)?</h3>
			<p>I have completed 5 years of full-time study at Macquarie University, graduating with a bachelor degree in Chiropractic Science (2005-2007) and a masters degree in Chiropractic (2008-2009).</p>
			<p>In 2011 I completed a 100-hour (check accuracy of this) post-graduate course and fulfilled/passed the examination requirements to become a certified Professional Applied Kinesiologist. (link to AK website)</p>
			<p>These are my formal qualifications, however the learning never stops as I continue to read, study, attend seminars, meet with other health practitioners, etc. in order to provide you with the highest quality of care and continue my growth as a chiropractor.</p>
			<p>I am also a member of the <a href="#">Chiropractors' Association of Australia (CAA)</a> and the <a href="#">Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)</a>.</p>
		
			<h3>What techniques do you use?</h3>
			<p>The techniques I use to assess and treat my patients have been carefully chosen/selected based on their safety, efficacy, and congruency with (what I believe to be the best approach to health care) my philosophy regarding health care (which you can read more about <a href="#">here</a>).</p>
			<p>First, do no harm. (include statistics of medically caused deaths/injuries)</p>
			<p>We humans are highly complex creatures. As a result there are a number of ways to assess and alter our function.</p>
			<p>Chiropractors have variety of techniques at their disposal to achieve the results they're aiming for.</p>
			
			<h5>AK</h5>
			<p>Applied Kinesiology (AK) is a non-invasive diagnostic method that uses manual muscle testing to evaluate the integrity of the nervous system. The nervous system monitors and coordinates every aspect of the body. On that basis, AK can be used to evaluate the whole body and is helpful in discovering the reasons for functional disturbances and also in finding a solution.</p>

			<h5>RNR</h5>
			<p>Hard-wired into the brainstem are a number of reflexes which help children survive the birthing process and the early stages of life before they develop the ability to make decisions. These are called 'primitive' or 'neonatal' reflexes. As the nervous system matures, the neonatal reflexes are supposed to take a 'back seat' and allow the higher processing or thinking areas of the brain to take control. In some cases, however, the neonatal reflexes remain dominant (often due to significant stress such as birth trauma). This disharmony in the nervous system can result in undesirable reactions in certain situations and can adversely affect development, learning, coordination, and behaviour.</p>
			<p>Specific structural corrections can assist the integration of Retained Neonatal Reflexes, thus restoring harmony within the nervous system and allowing children to develop to their full potential.</p>
			<p>May be the solution to chronic, recurring problems in adults.</p>

			<h3>What's your philosophy on health/approach to health care?</h3>
			<p>The approach I take to caring for myself, my family, and my patients is based on the scientific fact that the human body is a self-healing, self-regulating organism. Its instinct is to survive. You were designed to thrive.</p>
			<p>Whether this effort to survive is expressed as health or disease is dependent on the body's environment, both internal and external.</p>
			<p>If the body is provided with the ingredients required for health, health will result. If placed in a toxic, deficient environment, sickness and disease will result.</p>
			<p>Sickness and disease, however, is not due to a problem with the body's design, it is an expression of the body doing it's best to survive in a toxic, deficient environment.</p>
			<p>Symptoms are the expression of stresses and strains to which the body has been exposed, a response to everything in its environment.</p>
			<p>Symptoms are the body's way of communing that the current environment is not supporting its efforts to be healthy.</p>
			<p>My treatment methods and advice are geared towards/aimed at (working with this intelligent design) providing the body with an environment that encourages the expression of health, thus giving it the best opportunity to do what it was designed to do. Not only does this result in true, lasting health (rather than just symptomatic relief), it is also safe and free from harmful side-effects.</p>
			<p>Of vital importance to the body's ability to self-heal and self-regulate is the nervous system. The nervous system monitors and controls your entire body and determines how it will respond to any given situation. Movement is a vital nutrient for the nervous system - one that many of us don't get nearly enough of. Chiropractic assesses the health of your nervous system and helps provide the movement nutrients it needs to regain and maintain optimal function.</p>

			<h5>Philosophy</h5>
			<h5>What is it?</h5>
			<p>Chiropractic is primarily concerned with promoting (restoring, maintaining) a healthy nervous system. This is important because your nervous system controls, monitors and maintains the activity of every single cell in your body. Movement, especially movement of the spine, is of vital importance to nervous-system health.</p>
