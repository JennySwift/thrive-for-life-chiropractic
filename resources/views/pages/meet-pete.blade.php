        <p>Your health is arguably your most valuable asset, so it's nice to know who's looking after it (got your back), right? Take a moment to get to know me, and if you have any further questions or would like to make an appointment please feel free to
            <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>

        <h2>What do you love about being a chiropractor?</h2>
        <p>I love that it gives me so many opportunities to help people. I can't think of any aspect of life that isn't impacted by how well you feel. As a chiropractor I have the means to help people be well and have a positive impact on their life. This is both a privilege and a joy.</p>
        <p>I also love that fits beautifully into my natural, holistic approach to health care and allows me to provide a
            <a href="/services">service</a> that is congruent with my principles, values and beliefs.</p>

        <h2>What are your qualifications?</h2>
        <p>I have completed 5 years of full-time study at Macquarie University, graduating with a bachelor degree in Chiropractic Science (2005-2007) and a masters degree in Chiropractic (2008-2009).</p>
        <p>In 2011 I completed a 100-hour post-graduate Professional Applied Kinesiology course and passed the accompanying certification examination. (www.icaka.org.au) </p>
        <p>Those are my current formal qualifications, however I continue to think, read, study, attend seminars, meet with other health practitioners, etc. in order to provide you with the highest quality of care and continue my growth as a chiropractor.</p>
        <p>I am also a member of the Chiropractors' Association of Australia (chiropractors.asn.au) and am registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (www.ahpra.gov.au) and the Chiropractic Board of Australia (www.chiropracticboard.gov.au).</p>

        <h2>What principles, values and beliefs shape your approach to health care?</h2>
        <p>Your body is a self-healing, self-regulating organism with an intelligent instinct for survival. It is constantly monitoring and responding to every event that takes place - both internally and externally - consciously and unconsciously - at every moment of every day. The collection of events, your perception of them, and your response to them all come together to determine your position on the sliding scale of health and disease. </p>
        <p>If given the opportunity, your body will naturally gravitate towards health, well-being and vitality. (This is fantastic, and provides great hope to those who are unwell!) However, due to lifestyle choices and environmental stressors, the opportunity to thrive is often hindered or obstructed. When your body is provided with inadequate or toxic resources, it is unable to support both health and survival simultaneously. In such conditions, your feeling of well-being takes a hit in order to prioritize survival. While the survival response may result in symptoms that are unpleasant, they are necessary in order for life to continue in the given conditions. (May be helpful to include some examples.) The continuation of life, though unpleasant for the time being, gives you the wake-up call you need and an opportunity to make whatever changes are necessary to improve your conditions, thus allowing your body to return to the natural state of health it has been longing for! </p>
        <p>My aim, using a combination of (gentle, non-invasive/natural/restorative) treatment and lifestyle advice (training/coaching), is to work in harmony with your body's efforts to restore and maintain health, well-being and vitality. This approach to care is safe, effective, free from harmful side-effects, and provides benefits both now and for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>How does chiropractic care fit into this approach? Great question! Find out here. (link to 'Services - Chiropractic')</p>

        <h2>What do you like to do when you're not treating patients?</h2>
        <p>My interest in health doesn't stop when I finish work for the day. It infiltrates my whole life. After all, I need to keep myself healthy too! I enjoy learning about and doing pretty much anything that promotes health. Healthy eating and natural movement (I'm always up for a walk with family or friends) are two areas of significant interest at the moment, but I'm often coming across new and exciting things to investigate and try out. (Check out some of my recommendations in the
            <a href="/resources">resources</a> section.)</p>
        <p>Family is another important part of my life - both my biological family and my church family. It's a blessing to be able to share life with so many wonderful people! </p>
        <p>And the list wouldn't be complete without music. Whether it's listening to my favourite songs or playing my guitar, music brings much joy to my life. </p>
