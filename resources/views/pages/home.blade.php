			<h4 class="center">my treatment</h4>
			<p>My treatment methods are extremely safe, gentle and effective.</p>
			<p>The human body is nothing short of miraculous (miraculous/marvelous design/creation). It deserves great respect. The treatment methods I utilize have been carefully selected</p>
			<p>I believe that life is a miracle and that the human body is incredible. It deserves great respect. I have therefore taken great care in adopting/choosing treatment methods that are not only extremely safe, gentle, and effective, but that also work with your body's own efforts to adapt to its environment and be healthy.</p>
			<p>It is of great importance to me that the care I provide for my patients is of the highest quality. I have spent countless hours considering the best types of treatment and advice to offer that is safe, gentle, effective, and works with the natural intelligence of the body rather than against it.</p>
			<div>
				<p>When considering how I would like to be treated myself, and therefore how I would treat my patients, there are a number of criteria that needed to be met.</p>
				<ul class="">
					<li>safe</li>
					<li>effective</li>
					<li>gentle</li>
					<li>biologically congruent</li>
					<li>addressing cause rather than symptoms</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Your health is one of your most valuable assets.</p>
			<p>It takes a special person to choose chiropractic care.</p>
			<p>Is there any aspect of your life that isn't impacted by how well you feel?</p>
			<p>What are your goals in life? What would you like to achieve? Would you be more likely to succeed if you were healthy?</p>
			<p>Have you ever met the best version of yourself? Neither have I, but I bet they're amazing. Why not</p>
